## KnighHacks Hackthon 2016 ♘

This repository holds our code for our Hack at KnightHack

### What the hack does?
Basically the purpose of our hack was to use a amazondash button
hijack it and instead of ordering detergents or from amazon you get a
freshly delivered pizza ordered. 🍕🤓

## Repo Technology

+ __React-Native__ (first time using react-native 👍)
+ __Express__
+ __Node-Dash-Button__

Now we did this hack in about 14hours so if you choose to clone it be nice 😅
as it is rough around the edges.
